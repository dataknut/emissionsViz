# Visualising place-based greenhouse gas emissions

Visualising GHG emissions for neighbourhoods, places and districts using various data sources.

Borrows extensively from & was inspired by https://github.com/HCC-CCECF-DataGroup/hampshire-ghg-emissions

Examples:

 * [Framlingham](parish_Framlingham.pdf) (East Suffolk)
 * [Badingham](parish_Badingham.pdf) (East Suffolk)
 * [Botley](parish_Botley.pdf) (Eastleigh, Hampshire)
 * [Micheldever](parish_Micheldever.pdf) (Winchester, Hampshire) - an excellent example of how a major road/motorway can produce 'interesting' territorial emissions estimates
 * [Hambledon](parish_Hambledon.pdf) (Winchester, Hampshire)
