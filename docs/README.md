# Visualising place-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

Visualising GHG emissions for neighbourhoods, places and districts using various data sources.

Examples:

 * Hampshire ([County level emissions](https://hcc-ccecf-datagroup.github.io/hampshire-ghg-emissions/rmd/Hampshire_County_GHG_Emissions_v1.1.html) estimates)
   * Eastleigh
      * [Botley](parish_Botley_v2.pdf).
   * Winchester
      * [Hambledon](parish_Hambledon%20(Winchester)_v2.pdf) - a good example of a rural parish with a large share (~75%) of territorial emissions from road transport, agriculture and domestic heating oil. These are partially 'offset' by negative emissions (sequestration) from land use, land use change and forestry.
      * [Micheldever](parish_Micheldever_v2.pdf) - a good example of how a _major road/motorway_ (M3) can dominate territorial emissions estimates at the parish level.
   * New Forest
      * [Sway](parish_Sway_v2.pdf) - a good example of how a _major waste management_ site (?) can dominate territorial emissions estimates at the parish level.
 * Suffolk
   * East Suffolk
      * [Badingham](parish_Badingham_v2.pdf) - strongly agricultural (arable), rural village, off-gas.
      * [Framlingham](parish_Framlingham_v2.pdf) - agricultural (arable), rural town, on-gas.
 * Staffordshire
   * Staffordshire Moorlands
      * [Longnor](parish_Longnor (Staffordshire Moorlands)_v2.pdf) - strongly agricultural (dairy, sheep), off-gas
