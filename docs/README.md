# Visualising place-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

Visualising GHG emissions for neighbourhoods, places and districts using various data sources.

Examples:

 * Hampshire ([County level emissions](https://hcc-ccecf-datagroup.github.io/hampshire-ghg-emissions/rmd/Hampshire_County_GHG_Emissions_v1.1.html) estimates)
   * Eastleigh
      * [Botley](parish_Botley.pdf) (Eastleigh, Hampshire)
   * Winchester
      * [Hambledon](parish_Hambledon (Winchester).pdf) (Winchester, Hampshire)
      * [Micheldever](parish_Micheldever.pdf) (Winchester, Hampshire) - an excellent example of how a major road/motorway can produce 'interesting' territorial emissions estimates at the parish level
 * Suffolk
   * East Suffolk
     * [Badingham](parish_Badingham.pdf) (East Suffolk)
     * [Framlingham](parish_Framlingham.pdf) (East Suffolk)

## Background

Borrows extensively from & was inspired by:

 * work on visualising [Hampshire emissions](https://github.com/HCC-CCECF-DataGroup/hampshire-ghg-emissions).
